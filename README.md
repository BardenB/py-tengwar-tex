# py-tengwar-tex
A short Python 3 script to convert Quenya text in Latin alphabet to Tengwar commands to be used with the TengwarScript LaTeX package.

Usage: save a file with the Quenya text and run the script with your favourite interpreter.  You can also do it manually by importing this module and using the functions. The tengwar_roman_to_tex does the replacing.
